# About me
Welcome to my profile! Thanks for checking it out. Iâ€™m a a software developer and student in the Bachelor of Computer Science program at UBC. Prior to starting at UBC, I studied medicine at Queenâ€™s before switching tracks to become a software developer.

When Iâ€™m not at school, I work at a Vancouver-area startup called Bears Blooms, predominantly on backend API development. If you or someone you know in the Vancouver or Victoria area wants some flowers, check us out!

I also enjoy experimenting with and learning new technologies. Iâ€™m currently interested in Go, which has been a ton of fun to learn. Check out my first [blog post](https://adammitha.com/post/backtracking/) here where I talk about building an N-queens solver in Go.

My latest personal project has been focused on learning about Docker and Kubernetes, and how they can lower the barrier to entry for building reliable distributed systems. If you want to check out some of my work, you can find it on Github.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out on one of the social channels on my [website](https://adammitha.com/)!
